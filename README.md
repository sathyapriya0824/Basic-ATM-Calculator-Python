# Basic-ATM-Calculator-Python
A beginner-level Python project that simulates basic ATM operations including balance enquiry, cash deposit, and withdrawal. The program uses core Python concepts such as input/output, arithmetic operators, and conditional statements without loops or functions.

A simple ATM calculator implemented using Python to simulate essential banking operations including balance enquiry, deposit, and withdrawal. The project emphasizes fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, arithmetic operations, and decision-making using conditional statements. It is intended for beginners to understand real-world application logic without using loops or functions.
